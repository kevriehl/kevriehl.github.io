    <h2>Rewards</h2>
    <h3>Now, how do I get a Reward?</h3>
    <p>
      By going down the path of acquiring Rewards, you very clearly have picked the path of EARN. While many internet promotions look invalid, the truth is you are most likely passing on cash opportunities every single day.
    </p>
    <p class="last">
      Through our brand <a href=http://www.nationalconsumercenter.com>National Consumer Center</a>, you have access to countless only promotions all by following a very simple process broken down into an easy to understand point system. 
    </p>
    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <h4 class="last step">Step 1: Register</h4>
    <p class="last">
      There are many things that we can offer you besides your reward at National Consumer Center, including deals at top sites and continued ways to save money. In order for us to give you access to these deals, we just need a few lines of personal information from you!
    </p>
    <h4 class="last step">Step 2: Take our Survey</h4>
    <p>
      Once you register, the first step is to take our engaging and interactive survey so that we know what deals of ours are best to serve you. Without this, we wouldn't know what you would like best!

    <h4 class="last step">Step 3: View your Offers</h4>
    <p class="last">
      We work with tons of top brands in order to ensure that every experience you have at National Consumer Center is one that brings you back to our site. We want to match you with the best savings, apps, games, and experiences!
    </p>
    <h4 class="last step">Step 4: Pick your favorite Deals</h4>
    <p>
      At this point, you have made it to the last step. Pick your favorite of the deals we have gathered from the internet (They really are great deals. I personally like the Dr. Seuss Book Club deal the best), and make sure you fulfill the requirements. Once you are done, that is it - we will mail your reward straight to your mailbox!
    </p>
    <h4 class="last step question">Is this all too good to be true?</h4>
    <p>
      Absolutely not. We have TONS of happy customers that cannot stop talking about us - in fact, we have so many people coming back to our site, we are always having to find new and better savings offers and apps to keep them busy!
