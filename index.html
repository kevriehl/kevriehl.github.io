    <h3 class="arianepad">How does it work?</h3>
    <h4 class="last step">Step 1: Register</h4>
    <p class="last">
      There are many things that we offer you in addition to your reward at National Consumer Center - including deals at top sites and hidden ways to save money. In order for us to give you access to these deals, we just need a few lines of personal information from you!
    </p>
    <h4 class="last step">Step 2: Take our Survey</h4>
    <p>
      Once you register, the first step is to take our engaging and interactive survey so that we know what deals of ours are best to serve you. Without this, we wouldn't know what you would like best!

    <h4 class="last step">Step 4: Pick your favorite Deals</h4>
    <p>
      At this point, you have made it to the last step. Pick your favorite of the deals we have gathered from the internet (its basically like getting rewarded to shop... sign me up), and make sure you fulfill all of the requirements. Once you are done, that is it - we will mail your reward straight to your mailbox!
    </p>
    <h4 class="last step question">Is this all too good to be true?</h4>
