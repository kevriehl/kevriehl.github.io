Our goal is to provide you easy access to the various online sample and freebie lists that can be found all over the internet!

    <h3>So what is the catch?</h3>
    <p class="last">
      No catch. Various companies distribute their products to consumers totally free to spread the word about the products. Companies hope that by handing out free samples, individuals will enjoy their product and be inspired to go to the store and buy more of it. Companies come out with new product ideas all the time and one of the most effective advertising campaigns they have is offering free samples to the public. This works out for you, so that you don't spend money only to find you don't actually like the product!
